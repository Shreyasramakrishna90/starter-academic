## Summary

Tremendous advances have been made in the area of autonomous systems in the last decades, through self-driving cars, unmanned robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. Despite its widespread use, there are still challenges in designing fully autonomous systems, as guaranteeing the safety of such systems is challenging. My research work mainly focuses on developing research methods and tools for the safety of autonomous systems with machine learning components. To achieve this, I've worked on three different technical areas listed in the figure and implemented them through various research projects.
