## Summary

Tremendous advances have been made in the area of autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the last decades, through self driving cars, unmanned robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. Despite its wide spread use, there are still challenges in designing fully autonomous systems, as guaranteeing the safety of such systems is challenging. My research work is mainly focuses on developing research methods and tools for system level safety assurance for learning-enabled cyber-physical systems. To achieve this I've worked on three different technical areas which are listed in the figure and described below and each of these technical areas are summarized in different projects.
