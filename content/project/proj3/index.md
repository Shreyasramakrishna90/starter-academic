title:  Development of Assurance Case for design-time safety assurance
summary: System-level Assurance Case has become a critical requirement of the regulatory acceptance. However, problems such as human relaiance, lack of automation and design procedure makes it challenging to design a robust assurance case.

## Summary

As assurance cases have become an integral component for safety-certification in various CPS domains, including automotive, aviation, military, and medical devices. Despite the strict requirements, current practices still rely on manual methods that are brittle, do not have a systematic approach or thorough consideration of sound arguments. In addition, stringent certification requirements and ever-increasing system complexity make ad-hoc, manual assurance case generation inefficient, time consuming, and expensive. In this area, we improve the current state of practice by introducing a structured *assurance case generation (ACG)* method which uses system design artifacts, accumulated evidence, and developer expertise to construct an assurance case and evaluate it in an automated manner. Besides, we also focus on designing a tool called ALC to automate the entire design and testing of learning-enabled CPSs.
